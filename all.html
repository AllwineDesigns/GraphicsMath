<h1>Introduction to Graphics Math</h1>

<p>The fundamental mathematical structures used in graphics programming are the vector and the matrix.
In this introduction, we'll go over fundamental vector and matrix operations and how they apply to graphics programming.</p>

<h2>Vectors</h2>

<h3>What is a vector?</h3>

<p>A vector is just a list of numbers. In graphics programming a vector is often times a 3 element vector that represents
either a point in space or a direction. Another common vector is a 2 element vector that represents UV 
coordinates for texture mapping or 2D coordinates and directions. Once we get a little further along, we'll 
talk about 4 element vectors that represent homogeneous coordinates and how they tie in to transformation matrices. We'll 
start with 2 element vectors and work our way up. Below are several interactive demos that explain and visualize various
operations.</p>

<h3>Points and Directions</h3>
<div class="row" id="vectors2DDemo">
<div class="col-md-4">
<canvas width="300" height="300"></canvas>
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
<p>
<strong>A:</strong> (<span class="A"></span>)<br/>
<strong>B:</strong> (<span class="B"></span>)
</p>
<p>
Notice how a vector can represent a point or a direction. In this example there is virtually no difference between 
a point or a direction. Differences arise once we start transforming them with matrices (we'll get to that later). 
In mathematics, vector quantities are often bolded whereas scalar quantities (single numbers) aren't. 
We'll be following that style throughout this document. 

<span class="eq1">\[\textbf{A}=(A_x,A_y)=(1.0,1.0)\]</span>
<span class="eq2">\[\textbf{B}=(B_x,B_y)=(-2.0,3.0)\]</span>
</p>

</div>
</div>

<h3>Addition</h3>
<div class="row" id="additionDemo">
<div class="col-md-4">
<canvas width="300" height="300"></canvas>
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
<p>
<strong>A:</strong> (<span class="A"></span>)<br/>
<strong>B:</strong> (<span class="B"></span>)<br/>
<strong>C:</strong> (<span class="C"></span>)
</p>
<p>
Vectors can be added together by adding each of their components together. Visually, you're just attaching one vector
to the end of the other. The gray vector is B slid over to the end of A.

\[\textbf{C}=\textbf{A}+\textbf{B}=(A_x+B_x,A_y+B_y)\]
<span class="eq1">\[=((1.0)+(-2.0),(1.0)+(3.0))\]</span>
<span class="eq2">\[=\underline{\underline{(-1.0,4.0)}}\]</span>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Magnitude</h3>
<div class="row" id="magnitudeDemo">
<div class="col-md-4">
<canvas width="300" height="300"></canvas>
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
<p>
<strong>A:</strong> (<span class="A"></span>)
</p>
<p>
The magnitude of a vector is its length. The length of a vector is the square root of the sum of each component squared. 
In this case we have a 2 element vector, but the math extends to 3 element vectors as well by adding the z component (\(\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}\)).
In mathematics you'll see the magnitude of a vector represented by absolute value bars (|| or |) surrounding the variable.
\[magnitude=\|\textbf{A}\|=\sqrt{A_x^2+A_y^2}\]
<span class="eq1">\[\sqrt{(1)^2+(1)^2}=1.414\]</span>
<span class="answer">\[=\underline{\underline{1.414}}\]</span>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> Calculating the square root is a relatively expensive operation. 
Many vector libraries offer a squared length method which is faster because it doesn't have to perform a square
root. In cases where you don't need the actual length (such as comparing if one vector is longer than another), the
squared length is more efficient.

<h3>Normalization</h3>
<div class="row" id="normalizationDemo">
<div class="col-md-4">
<canvas width="300" height="300"></canvas>
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
<p>
<strong>A:</strong> (<span class="A"></span>)<br/>
<strong>B:</strong> <span class="B"></span>
</p>
<p>
A vector is normalized when its length is 1. It is also referred to as a unit vector. 
Any vector with a length greater than zero can be normalized. A vector can be normalized
by dividing each component by its magnitude. In this case B is a normalized version of A. In mathematics,
a normalized vector is often represented with a hat symbol (^) over the variable.

\[\textbf{B}=\hat{\textbf{A}}=\frac{\textbf{A}}{\|\textbf{A}\|}\]
<span class="eq1">\[=\frac{(1.0,1.0)}{1.414}\]</span>
<span class="eq2">\[=\left(\frac{1.0}{1.414},\frac{1.0}{1.414}\right)\]</span>
<span class="eq3">\[=\underline{\underline{(0.707,0.707)}}\]</span>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Things to try:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Drag A to (0,0). Notice how B is undefined. Zero vectors can't be normalized because dividing by zero is undefined. 
Implementations of normalize will sometimes just return (0,0) in that case, but don't assume so! Always be aware if a vector
you want to normalize could be a zero vector.</li>
<li>Drag A so its length is greater than 1. Notice how B is shortened to 1.</li>
<li>Drag A so its length is less than 1. Notice how B is lengthened to 1.</li>
</ul>
</p>

</div>
</div>

<h3>Dot Product</h3>

<div class="row" id="dotProductDemo">
<div class="col-md-4">
<canvas width="300" height="300"></canvas>
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
<p>
<strong>A:</strong> (<span class="A"></span>)<br/>
<strong>B:</strong> (<span class="B"></span>)<br/>
</p>

<p>
The dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of each of their components. Keep in mind that the dot product
yields a scalar value (a single number), rather than a vector.

\[\textbf{A} \cdot \textbf{B}=A_{x} \cdot B_{x}+A_{y} \cdot B_{y}\]
<span class="eq1">\[=(1.0) \cdot (-2.0)+(1.0) \cdot (3.0)\]</span>
<span class="eq2">\[=\underline{\underline{1.000}}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Things to try:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Move the vectors so they're pointing in roughly the same direction. 
When the vectors are less than 90 degrees apart, the dot product will be greater than 0.</li>
<li>Move the vectors so they're perpendicular to each other. When the the vectors are
90 degrees apart, the dot product is 0 (or very close to 0 when implemented with floating point numbers).</li>
<li>Move the vectors so they're roughly pointing away from each other. When the vectors are more than 90
degrees apart, the dot product will be less than 0.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
One example of how this information could be used is when deciding whether to render certain faces of an object to the 
screen.  The dot product of the direction of the face and the viewing direction can be used to make that decision. 
If the dot product is greater than 0, the face shouldn't be rendered because it is facing away from the viewer.
</p>

<p>
The dot product can be thought of as how much is one vector in line with another vector. Lighting and shading calculations 
often use the dot product to figure out how much light is being contributed to a given spot on an object. We're not going 
to get into that here. For more information search for diffuse or specular lighting calculations.
</p>

<p>
The dot product can also be used to find the angle between two vectors, and to project one vector 
onto another.  We'll get into that below.
</p>

</div>
</div>

<h3>Angle Between Two Vectors</h3>

<div class="row" id="angleBetweenDemo">
<div class="col-md-4">
<canvas width="300" height="300"></canvas>
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
<p>
<strong>A:</strong> (<span class="A"></span>)<br/>
<strong>B:</strong> (<span class="B"></span>)<br/>
</p>

<p>
The dot product of two vectors is also equal to the product of their magnitudes times the cosine of the angle between them:
\[\textbf{A} \cdot \textbf{B}=\|\textbf{A}\|\|\textbf{B}\| cos(\theta)\]

If we solve for \(\theta\) we get:
\[\theta=cos^{-1} \left(\frac{\textbf{A} \cdot \textbf{B}}{\|\textbf{A}\|\|\textbf{B}\|}\right)\]
<span class="eq1">\[=cos^{-1} \left(\frac{1.000}{(1.414)(3.606)}\right)\]</span>
<span class="eq2">\[=\underline{\underline{66.907^{\circ}}}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Things to try:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Drag either vector to the origin. Notice how \(\theta\) is undefined because of the divide by zero. When finding the
angle between two vectors, always check for zero vectors (or know that they will never be zero vectors).</li>
<li>Start with the vectors on top of each other. Drag one around until they are 180\(^{\circ}\) from each other, 
then keep going. Notice that the angle then gets smaller. The angle that is calculated is always the smallest 
angle between them, which is always between 0\(^{\circ}\) and 180\(^{\circ}\).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> If you know the two vectors are unit vectors (that they have a length of 1), you can avoid having to 
calculate or divide by their magnitudes. You also know that the dot product will range from -1 to 1 so to avoid having to
do the inverse cosine (an expensive operation compared to the dot product), you can compare directly to the dot product. For example, if you want to
check whether two unit vectors are less than 60\(^{\circ}\) apart, you can simply check whether the dot product is greater 
that 0.5 because \(cos^{-1}(0.5)=60^{\circ}\) and \(cos^{-1}(1.0)=0\).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> Be careful implementing this with floating point math.
At 0\(^{\circ}\) or 180\(^{\circ}\) inverse cosine can occasionally return NaN. 
Because of floating point math, dividing my the magnitudes sometimes 
yields values slightly below -1 or slightly above 1, when it really should
be exactly -1 or 1. Since the domain of inverse cosine is -1 to 1, clamping 
the input is necessary. Just another thing to be aware of when implementing
graphics math with floating point values!
</p>

<h3>Vector Projection</h3>

<div class="row" id="projectVectorDemo">
<div class="col-md-4">
<canvas width="300" height="300"></canvas>
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
<p>
<strong>A:</strong> (<span class="A"></span>)<br/>
<strong>B:</strong> (<span class="B"></span>)<br/>
<strong>C:</strong> (<span class="C"></span>)
</p>

<p>
When you project a vector onto another, you're taking the portion of the first 
vector that lines up with the second. Here, we're projecting A onto B, which 
yields C. To project one vector onto another, the second must be normalized. 
We then use the dot product of the first vector and the normalized second vector
to find the magnitude of the new projected vector. Then multiply that magnitude
by the normalized vector to get the final projected vector.

\[\textbf{C}=(\textbf{A} \cdot \hat{\textbf{B}}) \cdot \hat{\textbf{B}}\]
<span class="eq1">\[\hat{\textbf{B}}=(-0.555,0.832)\]</span>
<span class="eq2">\[\textbf{A} \cdot \hat{\textbf{B}}=1.941\]</span>
<span class="eq3">\[\textbf{C}=-1.941 \cdot (-0.555,0.832)\]</span>
<span class="eq4">\[=\underline{\underline{(-1.077,1.615)}}\]</span>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Things to try:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Drag A so it is in the same line as B. Notice that A is now the same as C since all of A can be projected onto B.</li>
<li>Drag B so it is on the x-axis. Notice that C now has the same x value as A.</li>
<li>Drag B so it is on the y-axis. Notice that C now has the same y value as A.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Matrices</h3>

<div class="row" id="matrixDemo">
<div class="col-md-4">
<canvas width="300" height="300"></canvas>
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
<p>
<strong>A:</strong> (<span class="A"></span>)<br/>
<strong>B:</strong> (<span class="B"></span>)<br/>
<strong>x:</strong> (<span class="x">1.0,0.0</span>)<br/>
<strong>y:</strong> (<span class="y">0.0,1.0</span>)
</p>

<p>
Matrices have a number of applications, but for our purposes a matrix represents
a coordinate system. Many matrix implementations allow the programmer to be 
oblivious to the underlying math that is going on. Often an abstraction layer
is placed around matrices (usually called a transform) so as a programmer, you're 
only dealing with three different vectors: translation, rotation and scale. This 
simplifies many tasks, but sometimes it's better to be able to think about a matrix 
in terms of its fundamental representation. A matrix is made up of a 2 dimensional 
array of numbers. We'll start with a 2x2 matrix to represent the coordinate frame in this demo 
(the pink coordinate frame):

<span class="eq1">\[\begin{bmatrix}1.0 & 0.0\\0.0 & 1.0\end{bmatrix}\]</span>

Each row in the matrix represents a vector. Notice how the first row is the 
vector (<span class="x">1.0,0.0</span>), a vector that represents the x-axis. The second row is the
vector (<span class="y">0.0,1.0</span>), a vector that represents the y-axis. We started with an identity matrix, which
represents an untransformed coordinate system. Setting x to (1.0,0.0) and y 
to (0.0,1.0) will get you back to an identity matrix.

Let's rewrite the matrix in vector
form:

\[\begin{bmatrix}\textbf{x}\\\textbf{y}\end{bmatrix}\]

You can transform a vector by a matrix by multiplying them together. When you multiply a vector and 
a matrix, you're multiplying each component of the vector with each vector in the matrix, similar
to how a dot product between vectors works.
Here is the math showing how A is being transformed into B. 
\[\textbf{B}=\textbf{A} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}\textbf{x}\\\textbf{y}\end{bmatrix}=A_x \cdot \textbf{x} + A_y \cdot \textbf{y}\]

<span class="eq2">\[=1.0 \cdot (1.0,0.0) + 3.0 \cdot (0.0,1.0)\]</span>
<span class="eq3">\[=\underline{\underline{(1.0, 3.0)}}\]</span>

</p>
<p>
Here's the same set of equations with all the vectors expanded, and standard matrix multiplication 
carried out:
\[\textbf{B}=(A_x, A_y) \cdot \begin{bmatrix}x_x & x_y \\ y_x & y_y\end{bmatrix} =(A_x \cdot x_x + A_y \cdot y_x, A_x \cdot x_y + A_y \cdot y_y)\]
<span class="eq4">\[=(1.0, 3.0) \cdot \begin{bmatrix}1.0 & 0.0 \\ 0.0 & 1.0\end{bmatrix}=(1.0 \cdot 1.0 + 3.0 \cdot 0.0, 1.0 \cdot 0.0 + 1.0 \cdot 3.0)\]</span>
<span class="eq5">\[=\underline{\underline{(1.0, 3.0)}}\]</span>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Things to try:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Drag x to (2,0) and y to (0,2). Notice how B and the pink axes are now scaled up by 2. You've 
created a uniform scale matrix. When the diagonal of your matrix is all the same number you have a 
uniform scale matrix.</li>
<li>Drag x to (0,-1) and y to (1,0). Notice how B is rotated 90\(^{\circ}\) from A. You've
created a rotation matrix. Whenever your matrix is made up of rows that are unit vectors that
are all perpendicular to each other, you have a rotation matrix.</li>
<li>Drag x to (1,-1) and y to (1,1). Notice how B is both rotated and scaled. A 2x2 matrix
can represent a scale and rotation, but not translation. We'll get to translation further down.</li>
<li>Drag x to (1,0) and y to (1,1). Notice how the pink coordinate system is skewed. This is called
shearing. Shearing happens when one of the axes has a component parallel to another axis. Here, we
have a horizontal shear because the y-axis is shifted along the x-axis.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Scale Matrix</h3>

<div class="row" id="scaleMatrixDemo">
<div class="col-md-4">
<canvas width="300" height="300"></canvas>
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
<p>
<strong>A:</strong> (<span class="A"></span>)<br/>
<strong>B:</strong> (<span class="B"></span>)<br/>
<strong>x:</strong> (<span class="x">1.0,0.0</span>)<br/>
<strong>y:</strong> (<span class="y">0.0,1.0</span>)<br/>
<strong>S:</strong> (<span class="S">1.0,1.0</span>)
</p>

<p>
A scale matrix can be constructed with a scale vector \(\textbf{S}\). The main
diagonal of a scale matrix is filled in with the values from this vector.

\[\textbf{S}=(S_x,S_y)\]
\[\textbf{x}=(S_x,0.0)\]
\[\textbf{y}=(0.0,S_y)\]

\[\textbf{B} = \textbf{A} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}S_x & 0 \\ 0 & S_y\end{bmatrix}\]
\[ = A_x \textbf{x} + A_y \textbf{y}\]
<span class="eq1">\[ = 1.0 \cdot (1.0,0.0) + 3.0 \cdot (0.0,1.0)\]</span>
<span class="eq2">\[ = \underline{\underline{(1.0,3.0)}}\]</span>

</p>

</div>
</div>

<h3>Rotation Matrix</h3>

<div class="row" id="rotationMatrixDemo">
<div class="col-md-4">
<canvas width="300" height="300"></canvas>
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
<p>
<strong>A:</strong> (<span class="A"></span>)<br/>
<strong>B:</strong> (<span class="B"></span>)<br/>
<strong>x:</strong> (<span class="x">1.000,0.000</span>)<br/>
<strong>y:</strong> (<span class="y">0.000,1.000</span>)<br/>
\(\theta\): <span class="theta">0.000</span>\(^{\circ}\)
</p>

<p>
To construct a rotation matrix we use trigonometic equations for a unit circle.
If <strong>x</strong> represents a point at an angle \(\theta\) around a unit circle, then it will equal:

\[\textbf{x}=(cos\ \theta, sin\ \theta)\]

To get a vector perpendicular to it, we flip the x and y values and negate x:

\[\textbf{y}=(-sin\ \theta, cos\ \theta)\] 

Then we can put it into a matrix and use it to transform A into B:

\[\textbf{B}=\textbf{A} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}cos\ \theta & sin\ \theta \\ -sin\ \theta & cos\ \theta\end{bmatrix}\]
\[ = A_x \textbf{x} + A_y \textbf{y}\]
<span class="eq1">\[ = 1.0 \cdot (1.000,0.000) + 3.0 \cdot (0.000,1.000)\]</span>
<span class="eq2">\[ = \underline{\underline{(1.000,3.000)}}\]</span>
</p>

</div>
</div>

<h3>Translation Matrix</h3>

<div class="row" id="translationMatrixDemo">
<div class="col-md-4">
<canvas width="300" height="300"></canvas>
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
<p>
<strong>A:</strong> (<span class="A"></span>, 1.0)<br/>
<strong>B:</strong> (<span class="B"></span>, 0.0)<br/>
<strong>C:</strong> (<span class="C"></span>, 1.0)<br/>
<strong>D:</strong> (<span class="D"></span>, 0.0)<br/><br/>
<strong>x:</strong> (<span class="x">1.0,0.0</span>, 0.0)<br/>
<strong>y:</strong> (<span class="y">0.0,1.0</span>, 0.0)<br/><br/>
<strong>T:</strong> (<span class="T">0.0,0.0</span>, 1.0)
</p>

<p>
So far we haven't differentiated between a point and a direction. When it comes
to translating them in space, we have to make a distinction. Points can be moved
around in space and their coordinates change, whereas a direction can be anywhere 
in space and will still be pointed in the same direction and still have the same
values. In this example, <strong>B</strong> is displayed relative to <strong>A</strong>.
At the origin, you'll see <strong>B</strong> is also displayed in gray. They're
both the same vector. Once we start translating vectors, we want to make sure
that directions aren't changed, but points are.

To do that we need to add an extra element to our vectors. The added element is
a weight that we'll indicate with the subscript w:

\[\textbf{A}=(A_x, A_y, A_w)\]
\[\textbf{B}=(B_x, B_y, B_w)\]

\[\textbf{x}=(x_x, x_y, x_w)\]
\[\textbf{y}=(y_x, y_y, y_w)\]

The added weight is a divisor for each of the other components. Our vectors
now represent homogeneous coordinates, rather than conventional coordinates.
To convert from homogeneous coordinates to conventional coordinates, divide
the weight into each of the other components and drop the weight:

\[(A_x, A_y, A_w) = (\frac{A_x}{A_w}, \frac{A_y}{A_w})\]

The weight has applications such as
in curve representations, but we won't get into that here. For more information
search for homogeneous coordinates. For our purposes, 
the weight will be either 1 or 0. When set to 0, the homogeneous coordinate 
represents a point at infinity, which represents a direction. When set to 1, 
the homogeneous coordinate represents a point in space. In this example, 
<strong>A</strong> is a point, <strong>B</strong> is a direction, 
<strong>x</strong> is a direction and <strong>y</strong> is a direction:

\[\textbf{A}=(A_x,A_y,1)\]
\[\textbf{B}=(B_x,B_y,0)\]
\[\textbf{x}=(x_x,x_y,0)\]
\[\textbf{y}=(y_x,y_y,0)\]

In order to perform translations, we'll need another vector <strong>T</strong>
which will be a point in space:

\[\textbf{T}=(T_x,T_y,1)\]

And now we have enough information to put it all into a translation matrix:

\[\begin{bmatrix}\textbf{x} \\ \textbf{y} \\ \textbf{T}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ T_x & T_y & 1\end{bmatrix}\]

We'll use it to transform <strong>A</strong> to <strong>C</strong> and 
<strong>B</strong> to <strong>D</strong>:

\[\textbf{C}=\textbf{A} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}\textbf{x} \\ \textbf{y} \\ \textbf{T}\end{bmatrix}=A_x \textbf{x} + A_y \textbf{y} + A_w \textbf{T}\]
<span class="eq1">\[=-3.0 \cdot (1.0, 0.0, 0.0) + 1.0 \cdot (0.0, 1.0, 0.0) + 1.0 \cdot (0.0,0.0,1.0)\]</span>
<span class="eq2">\[=\underline{\underline{(-3.0, 1.0, 1.0)}}\]</span>

\[\textbf{D}=\textbf{B} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}\textbf{x} \\ \textbf{y} \\ \textbf{T}\end{bmatrix}=B_x \textbf{x} + B_y \textbf{y} + B_w \textbf{T}\]
<span class="eq3">\[=1.0 \cdot (1.0, 0.0, 0.0) + 1.0 \cdot (0.0, 1.0, 0.0) + 0.0 \cdot (0.0,0.0,1.0)\]</span>
<span class="eq4">\[=\underline{\underline{(1.0, 1.0,0.0)}}\]</span>

It's important to note that throughout this document, I've been representing 
matrices and vectors using row vectors. Some people prefer to represent them as 
column vectors, which changes the order of multiplication. Here's the difference:

Row vectors (used throughout this document):
\[(A_x, A_y, A_z, 1) \cdot \begin{bmatrix}x_x & x_y & x_z & 0 \\ y_x & y_y & y_z & 0 \\ z_x & z_y & z_z & 0 \\ T_x & T_y & T_z & 1\end{bmatrix} =(A_x x_x + A_y y_x + A_z z_x + T_x,\ \ \ A_x x_y + A_y y_y + A_z z_y + T_y,\ \ \ A_x x_z + A_y y_z + A_z z_z + T_z,\ \ \ 1)\]

Column vectors (commonly used elsewhere):
\[\begin{bmatrix}x_x & y_x & z_x & T_x\\ x_y & y_y & z_y & T_y \\ x_z & y_z & z_z & T_z\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} A_x \\ A_y \\ A_z \\ 1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}A_x x_x + A_y y_x + A_z z_x + T_x \\  A_x x_y + A_y y_y + A_z z_y + T_y \\ A_x x_z + A_y y_z + A_z z_z + T_z \\ 1\end{bmatrix}\]

Notice how A is now represented vertically, as well as that each column of the matrix is a vector. 
Also, the order the matrices are placed in is flipped when multiplying. Applications such as Maya and 
Houdini as well as DirectX, use row vectors. OpenGL uses column vectors as well as Unity3D and you'll 
frequently see matrices and vectors written out in column vectors in mathematical 
documents as well as on Wikipedia. <br/><br/>

Row vectors vs column vectors can get especially confusing when you take into account how matrices 
are implemented. Matrix implementations generally store a matrix as a single array of numbers.
The layout of the array will be either row major or column major. Here's an example of both:
</p>
<p>
memory layout = ( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 )<br/><br/>
Row-major:<br/>
\[M = \begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 & 7\\ 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 \\ 12 & 13 & 14 & 15\end{bmatrix}\]
Column-major:<br/>
\[M = \begin{bmatrix}0 & 4 & 8 & 12\\ 1 & 5 & 9 & 13 \\ 2 & 6 & 10 & 14 \\ 3 & 7 & 11 & 15\end{bmatrix}\]

It can be confusing because row major and column major don't imply what format
the actual matrix is in (though, generally when when people say row major they
also imply row vectors, and column major implies column vectors). I ran into this 
confusion while implementing these demos. The demos are
implemented with three.js which uses WebGL (the OpenGL implementation for browsers) 
as its rendering engine.  In the three.js documention for the
<a href="http://threejs.org/docs/#Reference/Math/Matrix4" target="_blank">Matrix4 constructor</a>
it says the matrix is initialized "with the supplied row-major values". 
My first attempt to populate my matrix was as follows:<br/>
</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4"></div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<pre>
new THREE.Matrix4(xx, xy, xz, 0,
                  yx, yy, yz, 0,
                  zx, zy, zz, 0,
                  Tx, Ty, Tz, 1);
</pre>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4"></div>
<div class="col-md-12">
<p>

This would make sense if the matrix was in row vector format:
\[\begin{bmatrix}x_x & x_y & x_z & 0 \\ y_x & y_y & y_z & 0 \\ z_x & z_y & z_z & 0 \\ T_x & T_y & T_z & 1\end{bmatrix}\]

But what slipped my mind was that OpenGL represents their matrices as column vectors, so the matrix
was actually transposed. The correct way to input my matrix into three.js is as follows (which is
actually column-major order for the way I'm representing my matrices):<br/>
</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4"></div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<pre>
new THREE.Matrix4(xx, yx, zx, Tx,
                  xy, yy, zy, Ty,
                  xz, yz, zz, Tz,
                   0,  0,  0,  1);
</pre>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4"></div>
<div class="col-md-12">
<p>

Which is the correct row-major format when the matrix is in column vector form:
\[\begin{bmatrix}x_x & y_x & z_x & T_x \\ x_y & y_y & z_y & T_y \\ x_z & y_z & z_z & T_z \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}\]

When inputting your matrices manually, be aware of the difference between column-major and row-major 
input as well as column vectors and row vectors. Many texts and implementations 
assume you know which one they are using, so you often have to figure it out 
yourself.
